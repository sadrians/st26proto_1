> Secondary structure (HELIX, STRAND, TURN) - The feature table of sequence entries of proteins whose tertiary structure is known experimentally contains the secondary structure information corresponding to that protein. The secondary structure assignment is made according to DSSP (see Kabsch W., Sander C.; Biopolymers, 22:2577-2637(1983)) and the information is extracted from the coordinate data sets of the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
> 
> In the feature table only three types of secondary structure are specified: helices (key HELIX), beta-strands (key STRAND) and turns (key TURN). Residues not specified in one of these classes are in a 'loop' or 'random-coil' structure. Because the DSSP assignment has more than the three common secondary structure classes, we have converted the different DSSP assignments to HELIX, STRAND and TURN as shown in the table below.
> 
> DSSP code	DSSP definition	Swiss-Prot assignment
> H	 Alpha-helix	 HELIX
> G	 3(10) helix	 HELIX
> I	 Pi-helix	 HELIX
> E	 Hydrogen-bonded beta-strand (extended strand)	 STRAND
> B	 Residue in an isolated beta-bridge	 STRAND
> T	 H-bonded turn (3-turn, 4-turn or 5-turn)	 TURN
> S	 Bend (five-residue bend centered at residue i)	 Not specified
> One should be aware of the following facts:
> 
> Segment length. For helices (alpha and 3-10), the residue just before and just after the helix as given by DSSP participates in the helical hydrogen-bonding pattern with a single H-bond. For practical purposes, one can extend the HELIX range by one residue on each side, e.g. HELIX 25-35 instead of HELIX 26-34. Also, the ends of secondary structure segments are less well defined for lower-resolution structures. A fluctuation of one residue is common.
> Missing segments. In low-resolution structures, badly formed helices or strands may be omitted in the DSSP definition.
> Special helices and strands. Helices of length three are 3-10 helices, those of length four and longer are either alpha-helices or 3-10 helices (pi helices are extremely rare). A strand of one residue corresponds to a residue in an isolated beta-bridge. Such bridges can be structurally important.
> Missing secondary structure. No secondary structure is currently given in the feature table in the following cases:
> No sequence data in the PDB entry;
> Structure for which only C-alpha coordinates are in PDB;
> NMR structure with more than one coordinate data set;
> Model (i.e. theoretical) structure.
